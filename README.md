# Dockerized PXE

A Docker image serving as a standalone [PXE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment) (running dnsmasq). This server can be placed in an existing network infrastructure with an already configured DHCP server or in a network without any DHCP server.

This PXE currently serves:

- [MemTest86+](http://www.memtest86.com/)

## Dependencies

These are the dependencies required to build and run the container image:

- Docker 1.12+

## How to run

The `ENTRYPOINT` of this image is set to run `dnsmasq` in `no-daemon` mode.

You can add one or more desired `dhcp-range`s as command-line options. For more
information about dnsmasq command-line options, refer to [dnsmasq documentation](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html).

The easiest way to run containers based off this container image without configuring DHCP relays in your network,
is to run a such containers using the network of the host running them. If you're
using Docker, you can add the `--net=host` option when running the container:

```shell
docker run -it --rm --net=host ferrarimarco/pxe
```

### Integrated DHCP server

If you want to enable the integrated DHCP server for a given IP address range add a `dhcp-range` option: `dhcp-range=x.x.x.x,y.y.y.y,z.z.z.z` where `x.x.x.x` is the start of the range, `y.y.y.y` is the end and `z.z.z.z` is the subnet mask.

### Standalone DHCP server

If you want to use an existing DHCP server and let `dnsmasq` handle only the PXE, add a `dhcp-range` option: `dhcp-range=x.x.x.x,proxy` where `x.x.x.x` is the IP address of the server running dnsmasq.

## How to modify the configuration

All the configuration files can be modified at will. Look at the Dockerfile to see where they are (mainly in `/etc` and `/var/lib/tftpboot`) and overwrite them with your own (mounting volumes from the Docker host or rebuilding the image).

### Additional PXE Boot Menu Entries

If you just want to add additional menu entries to the boot menu, overwrite the contents of `/var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/additional_menu_entries` file.
The syntax for this file is described in the [syslinux documentation](http://www.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=Config).

#### Example: 2nd Memtest86+ plus Ubuntu 16.04 Boot Options

Here is an `additional_menu_entries` file to include (along with the default Memtest86+) two additional boot options: a customized Memtest86+ and Ubuntu 16.04.

## Testing and validating the setup

### Test dependencies

1. Virtualbox 5.1.16+
1. Vagrant 1.9.3+

### How to run the test environment

1. Check the IP address ranged configured by the Virtualbox DHCP server and configure your `dhcp-range` and `/var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default` accordingly.
1. Run the container with a suitable DHCP configuration and the `--net=host` option
1. Run `vagrant up` from the root of the directory where you cloned this repository. A Virtualbox VM (with a NATed network adapter) will boot from the given PXE.

#### Example

Virtualbox runs a DHCP server by default in each virtual network. If you want to test the PXE feature you have to run a
container based on this image with dnsmasq as a DHCP proxy (see [Standalone Mode](#standalone-dhcp-server)) and with the
host network stack (see the `--net=host` option) so you know in advance the IP address of the container running dnsmasq:
it's the same as the Docker host!

For example, if Virtualbox DHCP server assigns addresses in the `192.168.56.0/24` subnet (check the virtual network
configuration of the Host-only network assigned to a VM to gather this information),
then the `dhcp-range` option to enable a DHCP proxy could be: `dhcp-range=192.168.56.2,proxy`,
where `192.168.56.2` is the address assigned to the Docker host running the container based on this image in "host network" mode.

Remember to also update any IP address in `/var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default` you may have configured, if you serve any
content from the TFTP server (like a `preseed.cfg` for example) to point to the IP address of the container running this PXE.
**For this reason it could be useful to manually assign (or reserve) IP addresses (or better, hostnames!) for containers running this PXE.**
